Script to download 64 bit linux build from daily builds at https://builder.blender.org/download/


INSTALL

Edit downloader.py:
  set HOME to match your system	    # Do this!
  set BLENDER_DIR and DOWNLOAD_DIR as needed
  defaults are $HOME/blender and $HOME/Downloads

Copy downloader.py to your bin directory.
Make sure it is executable. ( chmod +x downloader.py )


Directory Structure & Files

$HOME/Downloads		# destination for downloaded archive
$HOME/blender		# unpacked archives and work files
  LAST_DOWNLOAD		# name of last downloaded archive
  blender-2.80-daily	# symlink to latest build dir
  blender-2.80-*-linux-glibc224-x86_64  # unpacked build dir. * is the hash

The blender exe is $HOME/blender/blender-2.80-daily/blender
This doesn't change when the build is updated so you can create a
blender-daily symlink in your bin dir.
